# Cloud vs On-site

* There are many situations where infrastructure on-site has its benefits however generally, it is better to use a cloud service.

1. Many companies especially start ups, will tend to fail eventually if they invest in on-site infrastructure. If they do not receive a sufficient enough return of investment after spending a lot on capital for on-site infrastructure, it can be detrimental for the company. There are also lots of operational costs.
    - When buying servers you will have to be awfully precise when predicting the success of the app.
    - If you oversucceed, your servers wont be able to take the capacity of demand in users which will cause the app to lose out on business.
    - If the app doesnt succeed, you would have spent extra capital on on-site infrastructure when it could have been spent on other resources.

2. Cloud deployment is very flexible, you can pay as you go. This is very handy for start ups who usually struggly withing the first few years. Also, it allows you to deploy your app globally as soon as you're ready to. There is a much lower operational cost and the servers wont even have to be managed by the company.
